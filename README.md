## Goal

The goal is to create a PiggyBack module to a standard "CP2102 USB module" and to have two PiggyBack modules:

- Modular 8/8 connector aka RJ45 with a MAX232 to elevate the RS232 signals to standard levels.

- D-sub 9 connector with a MAX232 to elevate the RS232 signals to standard levels.


## Modification

The CP2102 USB module needs to be modified. The 90 angel pins needs to be desoldered and replaced with a 1x6 female pin header.
